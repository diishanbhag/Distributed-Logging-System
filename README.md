#  Distributed Logging System

## Project Overview

In a microservices architecture, effective log management is crucial for operational excellence. This project aims to streamline the collection, storage, and analysis of logs generated by various services. By capturing relevant metadata, supporting real-time ingestion and querying, and enabling proactive alerting, this distributed logging framework enhances system visibility, resilience, and maintainability.

## System Architecture & Flow

### Components:

- **Microservices (Nodes):**
  - Generate logs independently.
  - Send periodic heartbeat signals to report status.
  
- **Log Accumulator:**
  - Collects and structures logs.
  - Forwards logs to a centralized system using a pub-sub model.

- **Pub-Sub Model (e.g., Kafka):**
  - Ensures reliable, asynchronous log delivery.

- **Log Storage (Elasticsearch):**
  - Stores logs in a searchable, indexed format.

- **Alerting System:**
  - Monitors for `WARN` and `ERROR` logs and triggers real-time alerts.

- **Heartbeat Mechanism:**
  - Detects node failure by monitoring heartbeat messages.
